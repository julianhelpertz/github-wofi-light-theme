# GitHub Wofi Light Theme

This is a very simple stylesheet, which styles the wofi searchbar according to the <br>
official GitHub light theme guidelines.

## Installation <br>
**1.** If you already applied a theme and want to save it, make sure you back up the old stylesheet. <br>
`mv ~/.config/wofi/style.css ~/.config/wofi/styleBckUp.css`

**2.** I used [NerdFont](https://www.nerdfonts.com/), so make sure you have the fonts installed <br>

> **OR**: If you don't want to use [NerdFont](https://www.nerdfonts.com/), make sure to edit the font family on line **10** <br>
> to any family you have installed.
>
> `* {
>   font-family: 'CaskaydiaCove Nerd Font', monospace;
>   font-size: 18px;
> }` <br>

**3.** Download or copy the *"style.css"* to `~/.config/wofi/` and leave the name *"style.css"* <br>

**4.** Aaand you're done. Open wofi with your preferred keyboard binding(mine is Super+Space) and it should look like this: <br>
