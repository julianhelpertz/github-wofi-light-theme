# GitHub Wofi Light Theme

This is a very simple stylesheet, which styles the wofi searchbar according to the GitHub light theme.

## Installation
**1.** If you already applied a theme and want to save it, make sure you back up your old stylesheet.  
> `mv ~/.config/wofi/style.css ~/.config/wofi/styleBackUp.css` <br/>
<br/>

**2.** I use [NerdFont](https://www.nerdfonts.com/), so make sure you have the fonts installed.

> [!TIP]
> If you don't want to use NerdFont, the default fallback font is `monospace`. So you have to change nothing. <br/>
> However, you can change the font family in the `*` block at the beginning. <br/>

<br/>

**3.** Download or copy your preferred *"style.css"* to `~/.config/wofi/` and leave the name *"style.css"* or set the path in the config. <br><br>

**4.** Aaand you're done. Open wofi with your preferred keyboard binding(mine is Super+Space) and it should look like this: <br><br>
